# 👋 Hey, I'm Mike Jones

🎯 I'm a Security Professional transitioning into IT — driven by a passion for technology and hands-on problem-solving.  
💻 Currently studying the **Google IT Support Certificate**, with plans to earn **CompTIA A+**, **Network+**, and **Security+**.  
🔧 I’ve already built and documented real-world projects in **networking, hardware repair, server setup**, and remote support.

## 🚀 Projects In Progress

- **🔐 Home VPN with Tailscale** – Secure access to my home network from anywhere

More coming as I build out each certification with hands-on practice.
